# BaseTDD FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz TDD in a Visual Studio Solution using angularJS

## TDD
* Start with writing a test which fails
* Implement the function to make the test succeed
* Refactor

## FizzBuzz Requirements
* The FizzBuzz Service accepts a number and returns a string.
* If the number is divisible by 3 the result is "Fizz"
* If the number is divisible by 5 the result is "Buzz"
* If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 the result is "FizzBuzz"
* If the number is neither divisible by 3 nor by 5 the result is the number as string
* Special Case: 0 should return '0'
